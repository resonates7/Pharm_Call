And then , there's also research triangle in North Carolina , and there's also consumer healthcare and [##redacted##] New Jersey .

And again , sir , I don't have a name . I just have sight information . I don't have a name of who runs all of those facilities. .  Well , are there any departments , that's the old , are there any departments that , that , uh , are concerned with consumer relations.

So , it's , it's a particular product to precise precisely . Ugly , why would I be calling black , GlaxoSmithKline if I were complaining about a product of another company . So , I'm calling about.  I was asking if you had a specific , I understand . I'm trying to help you . What is the product ? And maybe I can get , uh , a nurse or a pharmacist to assist you with the feedback. . .  No .  Okay , but I , I , you know , I don't , I , I don't want to speak to an underlying . I want to speak with someone , an upper management at the very least , because I want my opinion to be her.

      " \"Thank you for calling the response center . My name is that and then I'm a registered nurse . How am I going to assist you today ? . . Oh , at them . You have Mister Anonymous on the line . He wants to speak to someone about a Breo . He doesn't want to talk to , he wanted a pharmacist . I told him I couldn't guarantee you a pharmacist , but he's not a very pleasant gentleman.  Lucky you ..  Not so far . I don't mind that . What , what kind of , what's he , , what's he need ? I mean , what's he trying to get ? .  Okay .. . .  He , he just wanted information about Breo . And then , he said he wanted to get feedback about Breo , and I told him I would be glad to take any information that he had , on Breo , and he said , no , I want to talk to someone else , and I said , all I have are pharmacists in the nurses . He said , I'll be glad to speak to one of them.  .  Okay , me too . I'll take it ..  Thanks at them.  Thank you ..  Hello , my name is at him . I'm a registered nurse with , uh , GSK response center . Uh , I was just speaking with the previous agents . She mentioned that you had some questions about Breo . Uh , how can I help you today ? . . . .  Um-hum .. .  Well , I've been attempting to reach somebody to give some feedback , because I , um , I have this , because of my current health status , I was prescribed Breo Ellipta , and I was told by the pharmacist , because I was shocked when I found out what , what it cost , and so the pharmacist said , well , they have some kind of a program or a GlaxoSmithKline , and you have coupons , whatever , to reduce the price , and , um , but the pharmacist can't do it , , the patient has to call . So I called . They took all sorts of information , and then they told me they couldn't help me . Um , and , of course , that's infuriating , in addition to the fact that this is a medication that I , my doctor says. . . . . . . . .  Need , and so I was trying to give feedback and complain that that's not right , that you have coupons for , like , two items . I mean , in this time , with inflation , the way it is , and the expense of the item , I mean , the , there's anybody at that company , does the , does the , does the damn , uh , alarms lead ? Does , I mean , does , does anybody listen ? I mean , what if it were , what if it were your mother , or her mother , that needed this medication . There are people out there who are going through difficult times , and , and , uh , I mean , uh , uh , uh , why don't you , why don't you make some discounts available to people ? What is this ? I mean , how great are you going to accompany be ? I mean , you haven't the pharmaceutical companies made out like bandits or nothing the last couple of years ?  .  It's just , it's unreasonable , and on top of it , I'm 65. Uh , closer to 66 than 65. So , you know , there's , there's a , a , a limited amount of money that I've dispensed for this stuff . , it's just unreasonable . And nobody. . . .  Any help ? Nobody knows anything . Every , uh , every number you call goes to a call center , okay ? That , nobody's accountable . They just send it to people like you . That's not the field calls like this . And all the people that are making the millions , hide behind their desks , it's outrageous . I mean , all you have to do is put a human element on it , pretend it was your sister , your mother , your father , your uncle , or you.  Very , very simple , and then you can understand what other people are going through.  Okay ..  .. .  .. .  .  Yeah , yes , sir , I can certainly identify with , uh , your Synthroid , and I understand how you feel . I will be happy to capture this in a patient feed back the case . Uh , the other thing I could suggest , sir , is there is an , an apt to call survey , and I know many people don't care for after call surveys , but this particular one , if you score out a certain way by your answers , then it is automatically reviewed by GSK , uh , the higher level . So I would , uh , highly encourage you to , to take the Asacol survey . Part of it will be , you know , how did I treat you on this call , but the rest of it is , like , you know , how , how , how do you feel about GSK ? How do you feel about our products , and I would , uh , definitely encourage you to take that , and that way you could speak to GSK in your own voice , if that makes sense .. .  .  I see . So they're going to take a recording of my own voice.  .  Well , I mean , it's , uh , you , you , you're , you're , uh , basically the first half of the call.  Okay .  In other words , you can't just perspect , press one for a very dissatisfied . They , they , they record your voice.  You , you can do that as , you can do that as well , but then there's also an option that , uh , at the end of it , to , to leave comments , uh , if you , if you would like , not required , though. . .  Hum .. .  I see . I love the , I love these companies . Don't you ? They , they , they take surveys . They , they , the first questions they ask are how you did , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the functionary who's getting paid a , immediately little salary , and then they never want to hear a feedback on their lousy policies that all these people making multi millions of dollars at high , behind their den titles , like , name and alarms lakes , okay , who worked for an alcohol company , and now is in charge of a , of a pharmaceutical company , go figure , right ? I wish I , I , uh , made it in classics and mod , modern languages like she did . Um , and , and , uh , what , what , what , what had poker received . They don't want to get any criticism of themselves . They just want to dump it on you , the underlying , who's got a field calls like this . It's just ridiculous . It's insulting . We're all getting screwed and , and , and , and , and , and they're getting richer by the minute , and I'm no socialist , but this is outrageous . Four hundred fifty dollars for this stupid thing , you got to be credit , kid.  Yes , sir . I , I can't , uh. . . . .  .  Yeah , I'm.  Is , is there anybody , is there anybody , I know , I , I , I hear in your voice that you know exactly what I'm talking about . There's a limited amount that you could say , because you work for the stupid company , but you know very well what I'm saying is true . And it's outrageous , okay ? And to do this to people that need medication , it's not like I'm , I'm , I'm , I'm having a trip to heat , to heat hey or something , which is completely optional , okay ? This is a medication , just , these people should be in prison . Is there anybody at a higher level that I can actually speak to in person , because calling this number goes nowhere as you may know . It goes to the cold centers , because they're all hiding under their desks , or hiding under their yachts or something . Um , I mean , there's no , I looked online . There's just no number where you can actually call where somebody works . It's just , it just fumbles it out to call centers . How would I reach any of these people that are upper level management ? Where , where are they hiding ? .  On , on . Yeah . Unfortunately , you have about as much access to that information as I do , so I really don't have anything to offer as far as , you know , what you're seeking . Unfortunately . As much as I'd love to give it to you , I , I just don't have access to that information at either . . . . .  All right .  Is it , what , what , what a world . I just wonder when everybody's going to rehab , you know , and we have a , a Marriott when that part , too . It's just outrageous . It's just outrageous . These people hide behind their walls . Oh , but don't , don't come by wrong , we all know that walls don't work , but they hide behind their walls , somehow they build their walls , and everybody else has got to deal with every , all the other garbage . And we're left holding the bag . It's just , I'm so tired of holding the bag . That's the problem . I'm really tired of holding the bag . And when I saw this , it was literally sticker shock . I thought , I , I thought when , when they told me what the , what the , what the copay was , I thought that he didn't understand . And , uh , and I thought , I said , that was the full price , and then he told me the full price was $400 . 00 for something like $450 . 00 or $470 , 000.  .  Roughly , yes .. .  .  ?  Yeah .. .  Okay .  Like that . Uh , if , outrageous , and , and aren't , and I'm a musician in a church , how much do you think people like me make , and this thing , 75 bucks a month , okay ? Just unbelievable , just unbelievable . That's the copay from , from , with , with my lousy insurance , that's the copay , and go call their stupid Lyme there with their patients assistant program . The moment you say that you have some kind of insurance , any kind of insurance . You could get the insurance from the Botox on the corner . It doesn't matter . The moment you mentioned that you have some , it doesn't matter if the world's crepitus insurance . The moment you use the word insurance , they're like , sorry , goodbye . And , , what happened to the coupons ? Oh , we used to have a coupon . Now , we only have two combo , two coupons . Do you take this medi , well , I'll tell you what . I'll change my medication just so I can get a coupon . Just as crazy . Just as crazy . I mean , it's , it's , it's a crazy , it's insulting , and , and it's , and it backbreaking , and it's wallopbreaking , and it's just , it , I , I don't know what , what could possibly. .  Also this much that they do . And it's all made. .  Uh-huh ..  Yes , sir , I do.  So sick people , it's , that's , that's the flying thing of it all . I mean , this , these companies , they're , they're making money off sick people . Okay , all right . Uh , I , I've sent it enough , and I've wasted enough of your time , I know , I know you're sympathized , and I can hear in your voice that you understand what I'm saying . It's just very , very freaking frustrating.  I do , and I do understand , and I'm going to offer you that after call surveys as soon as we conclude , okay ? .  Yeah , I'll , I'll give him an earful , but I'll , I'll , I'll , I'll give you good marks.  . Very good . . Yes , sir . Have a great day . Thank you for calling you . Okay ..  All right . So I just told , uh , I just told on the line.  I just hold on the line , is that what it is ?  Yeah .  Okay ..  Yes , sir . I'll , uh , just hold one moment . I'll transfer you right now ..  .  Okay , thank you . ..  Yes\"\n",

Uh , I keep being given numbers where there is no one study answers . We're unable to answer your phone call . Today , but it's every day . So it's obviously some kind of codependency .  I , I , you know , I'm trying to buy , hold on , I'm trying to buy . No , ma'am . I'm sorry . What did you say ?. .  That's fine , but I need an answer . That's the problem.  I was going to tell you that they are splitting off to become another company , so there have been intermittent times in this past week , that , yes , ma'am , they have been closed , so I , I apologize for the inconvenience for you , but we don't support that platform . We can only transfer you to the only number that we have . Now , , that is the consumer helped department . It's separate from what we do here at the response center , which is pulmonary drugs and oncology . So , I apologize , I don't have any better thing to tell you or offer you.  Well.  Okay . Okay , so what can I do for you ?.  Well , I mean , do I need to call the President of the company ? I mean , I understand . That , that's not your thing . I get that . I understand that . I , I'm a business woman myself , but what I don't like , with a company that tries , that just gives you numbers that don't answer . I need a number , that's going to answer , and tell me.  Well , like I said , it's , it's becoming a separate company.  It's becoming.  Okay ..  Well , then that's not going to help me at all . I , that's not , I know that . I understand what you're saying . But that's not an , an answer that's helpful . In fact , it's even more confusing . ..  I , I , that's all I have , because it's not our company anymore . So , I'm sorry ..  Well , who can you give me too ? But who can use them ?  Who can you give me to then , then can , who can , eventually , get me an answer . That's the question ..  Those are the answers . Uh , that's the number we have . What's your specific , uh , uh , products , Miss Banner.  It's Gaviscon . Well , you don't , uh , deal with that , so.  I still have numbers for it.  So , I was just going to see.  Yes .  Um-hum.  Um-hum . Well , I was given cucumbers , and , uh , the one for the Gaviscon numbers is 8:00 , 8:00 , 8:00 , 3:00 , 6:00 , 7:00 , 6:00 , 4:00 , 7:00 , 1:00 . Is that the number you're going to give me ?.  Hi .  Okay , so it's Gaviscon . It's bad .  Um-hum.  I don't know . I have to look it up for you . Gaviscon is 8:00 , 8:00 AM , 3:00 , 6:00 , 7:00 , 6:00 , 4:00 , 7:00 , 1:00.  Yes , no answer ..

I can speak with the corporate office .  .  Uh-huh . What's the number in London ?  No , you have one in Pennsylvania . You have it .  Oh , okay . .  Yes , but they don't answer ..  ..  Um-hum ..  , uh , ma'am , I'm , I'm not disputing . We have sites , three or , three sites in Pennsylvania , and we have sites , but they're not corporate offices . So , the number for the consumer help is the $800 245 , 1040. And , like I said , you know , I understand it's frustrating for you , and that's because their transitioning to be their own company , and I'm sorry it's inconvenient , and you , I really am , but the numbers that I've given you are all that I have.  Oh , you are . I understand . I , and I understand you .. . .   I appreciate that , but , but I don't want to do it at your , uh , , I guess you don't , I'm not making myself clear . I understand what you're saying .  Okay .  So those numbers , can I think for a moment , so those numbers are not going to help me . I get that . I need a number that I can give me some other information , so it's in a completely different department . I will need a number . I need a number that overseas , , those kinds of departments.  Well , it's another company now . So , unfortunately , I don't have any more numbers . Uh , that's all I have.  So , GlaxoSmithKline does no longer.  Gaviscon ? Is that what you're saying ?.  Okay ..  I'm saying that it's becoming another company split off from GSK . I haven't been privy to the name of the company . We haven't been privy to any of the other telephone number.  Okay .  That may I speak to someone , and she S , uh , then I need to speak to somebody in , well , actually , one ..  I don't know who to give you to .

Yeah , I wasn't able to heal , and then when I went home , I did clean it , but , uh , you know , still , uh , a lot of medication comes , you know , goes up . I don't think that's normal , you know . I think the medication should , should come to the mouthpiece , not go up. .  Okay . If it's going up through the top , then that means , is this the first time you've ever used this device.  What is the first time I ever used the disk device , the Flovent , but I use another device , it's similar.  .  Okay . So , um , if the medication is actually coming up in exiting out to the top , that means that the full dose is not being inhaled , okay , so , um , that's that issue , but is , did , is the device working now that it's , that it got cleaned ? .  .  Well , no , it's not working . It's still the same issue as I had before . Even if I cleaned it.  .  Okay . So , how did you clean it. . .  With the problems of the , the way that the guy told me yesterday , you know , take , uh , gotten swollen , was inside , uh , with a little bit of water , including the hand over there , and then , you know , with the other part of , of , of the dry one , cleaning.  Okay .  Okay . So , what is the issue. . . .  Okay ,.  And , uh , this is not normal . I mean , this is , you know , uh , right now , I have , uh , one on 109 , because I think two or three parts , you know , I , I lost , uh , cleaning it and doing the , so I use it only for three days , and this is not normal , you know , even , I mean , you clean it , okay , I , , I cleaned it after two days . But , uh , it did the , it did , uh , this thing , uh , you know , since the beginning , since I took it . So , I don't think this is , uh , this is . Yes ..  Okay . So , what it , so , the issue is , is that there's medication coming out the top of the device.  ?  Yeah .. .  Okay . So , , come in , like I said , if it's exiting out the top , then that means that when you go to take this medication , what happens if you , if , if you don't inhale the full dose of medication , it is going to escape out the top.  Well , that's , that's why I'm calling , you know , because I'm not able to get the full dose of medication.  Right , so what happens is that , so when you put the , so when you put the device in your mouth , what you want to do is you want to press down and you want to in , take a deep inhalation at that same time . .  Yes , I'm doing that now , but when I push down , the medication goes up . What's so hard to , to understand ?. .  Okay . Uh , that's what I'm saying , sir , is if the medication goes up out , if it is going up out of the top of the device , then.  Uh.  .  . Listen , listen , the , the , the device that you gave me is not working properly , you know . So , what is so hard to understand ? When I push down , when I push down , the medication goes up.  Okay . So , . Okay . So.  Instead of coming to my mouth . So you're saying that my fault or what do you think ?.  So , so if you have the device right now , do you have the device in front of you.  Yes , I have the device in my , my hand.  Okay . So , what I want you to do without , without it being in your mouth.  I just want you to , to , this spray it.  Facing away from you . Don't , don't spray it towards you . You just spray it facing away from you ..  .  Yes , and you'd come , you'd come both ways . It comes up and in front . I did that. . .  Okay , so it's coming up and out the front .  .  So , are you sure it's the medication coming up out of the top or is it just , like , air ?. .  Okay ..  Listen now . How can I , where can I take this , uh , this device to a professional , to check , you know , because I'm not going to stay all day on the phone to explain it to you , what happens , okay ? I got it from the pharmacy , the pharmacy won't take you back . Where can I give it back and , and forget about it ? You know , do you have my motor home , send the money back to the , the , the insurance or whatever it is , or don't even tell them , but , you know , just tell me what to do with the medication , because I'm not going to say one hour will be two on the phone . To explain to you what happened .. .  Okay . Just.  Yesterday , hello . Yesterday I was told that if it really happens , you're going to replace it with a better one , with a new one . So , now you are , you know , keeping me on the phone for half an hour. .  I'm telling you , this is what happened . The medication goes up inside of coming to my mouth. . .  Okay . So , how do you want me to prove that ? Do you want me to , to , uh , to make a video to show it , or how , how do you want me to do that ? You want me to go to a certain place ? I go to the pharmacy and they , they check it . What do you want me to do ?  .  It's wrong , the medication , the vitamin you gave me is wrong . You have to replace it , , okay ?.  .  . All right , just one minute , sir.  ..  All right . ..  Okay ?  Okay ..  Yes , so , um , I was just , um , checking with some other agents to see how I handle this , because , um , when , like I said , when it comes out the top , it's not usually a product issue with a , um , uh , it's an issue with just not inhaling the dose completely . Now , prior to you using the , um , medication , the , the first time , um , did you prime this device ? .  He has ma'am , I do have a problem with his divorce , has had the fracture of his hip four times , four times.  Okay , so you , um , so you shake it for about five seconds , spray it , shake it for five seconds , spray it.  .  Exactly . Exactly ..  Okay , and then you shake it prior to , um , you shake it for five seconds prior to taking the dose of medication as well.  .  Yes , ma'am , every time when I take the medication , I , I shake it for five seconds.  Okay . So , but the medication is coming out of the mouthpiece as well , correct ? So the medication is drying out.  . It , it , it , it's a little bit comes to the mouthpiece , but it also goes up. . . .  Okay . And , um , you said that , um , when you , so when you push it down , do you , do you , um , do you , do you push it down and hold the canister.  Down for a few seconds. .  Okay , lithium , lithium , lithium . Yesterday , I spoke with the person , you know , I explained to him everything , but he told me to clean the , the , the mouthpiece . I did it , and now I have to go through again , and he said if it happens , you're going to replace it . No , I have to go through all this again with you , and you probably going to say that it is not your fault , it's my fault , so forget it about it , I'm going to hang up and goodbye .\"\n",

Tell your people , okay ? I never knew that there would be any side effects from this vaccine . The doctor never said , oh , but if you , you know what I mean ? Like , they , they sent me this percentage of people that may have of that adverse reaction to the vaccine , to the shingles vaccine , right ? They sent me after the fact . Don't you think that when a doctor says , don't you think you want to get the shingles vaccine , ? Please say , what do I need that for ? I'm healthy , because you don't want to get shingles . Never told me that there could be a side effect , nothing . She was a woman . I trusted her . You know , she's , I was a woman internist doctor . Nobody said anything when I got it at the drugstore where I got it . Nobody said , well , you know that there is , uh , risk with this , you could come down with it . Nobody said it , because she said that , oh , you wouldn't come down with it , because they don't have the live , you know , vaccine in it . So , I said , well , how does the body identify with it when it has to have something to identify with it , to bring it on , because it was some type of protein . I went to a urolog. .  It's a PhD . A friend of mine . He went and did research on it . He said there was something in there that did this to you . I mean , the thing is , it's so painful that I can't even function , and here I am two and a half years later , and now I got to bring a wall suit , and I got to do it , because someone said this morning , well , nobody would have taken this . How does he know nobody would take it.  You , you're , this morning.  Because you were sent in the 80s and don't you think people should , yeah ? Go ahead ..  This morning , you spoke to someone here ? And they said that ?  ?  Oh ..  They did not speak to someone there . I did , did not speak to someone there.  Okay ..  Um-hum ..  Um-hum. . .  Okay .  Yeah ..  Um-hum . ..  I just know it .  Okay .  Uh , because I'm representing myself , and I only have six months to , to bring this against them . I mean , it's not their fault , but who's full is it ? How do they expect me to live with this kind of pain every day ? For the rest of my life . You know , uh , they should have said there's a risk , and then I would have said , well , no , I wouldn't not have gotten it . You know , somebody had Tysabri responsibility for this . I cannot live like this . We live in a very narrow society that's based upon the physical . Everything gets physical . And women at the age are throwing out mis society . You've got to have all your faculties , to exist in to , to , to , to live . Do you know what I mean ? And I come up sick , because you sent me after the fact . I read all your literature . I saw it's 6% that may have not had a good response . Don't you think that's responsibility of the doctor telling you ? You know , I won't even get the damn pneumonia shot now . I didn't have to get the shingles shot . Because of what's in my head . But even that shingles shot , they're not responsible . They're supposed 10 years down the line . They fuck with your B , sorry . God forgive me for the cursing . You know , those bright proteins go in into your GNA . You know. .  Suppose people are going to have to come down with shit ..  I do .

      " \"To call on GSK , my name is Miss [##redacted##] , and I am a nurse , I may as well today. Uh , I got a couple of questions about the shingles vaccine. .  Okay .. . .  Uh , I , I've got , uh , occasions shingles . It's been going on for two and a half years . Uh , I've talked to , uh , seven doctors , and , uh , uh , pretty general practitioners and , uh , four neurologists , uh , six of them say , uh , won't help . Um , if I get a , uh , go get a shingles vaccine now , one says it may be , uh , maybe I'm getting a re-infection , and this might cigarette reinfection , um. .  One says that , uh , uh , getting your shingles vaccine now , while I have the shingles , may make it worse.  Okay.  Uh , which of those opinions was , uh , uh , agreeing with , uh , your research.  Uh.  Okay . Um , uh , uh , none fully . Okay , so the first thing is that shingles will not help , which occurs shingles outbreak . It's only to prevent possible further recurrences . So , no , it won't help with the current outbreak that you have . Um , the other thing is , is that you cannot receive the shingles vaccine while you have an active outbreak . You have to be beyond that outbreak in order to receive it , so it can't be administered during an active outbreak . Um , the doctor that told you that it may actually prevent reinfection , that is possibly true , uh , well , partially true , so it , once you get over this active infection , if you do decide to get it , it will lower your risk for reinforcement , . You can only get it after your active infection has resolved .. . . .  So , uh , uh , are , are you saying that , uh , uh , there's , uh , no , you're scheduling the vaccine then at this point , or that I should go , uh.  Uh , exactly , , uh , no , sir , while you have an active infection , you should not receive the shingles vaccine.  Exactly . That's correct ..  I should not get it . It says I've already got it . . Is that what you're saying ? Okay . Well , do you , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , just offhand , uh , do you have any idea , uh , none of these doctors seem to , uh , know anything about shingles ? Uh , do you have any idea , uh. .  .  Uh ..  Um.  Uh , uh , who am I contact , or is there any organization of shingles sufferers or anything like that ? Certainly , there's someplace that , uh , a doctor , uh , knows what to do about this , uh , shingles , it's been going on for hundreds of years , by now , they should have thought of something that , uh , might help it . Uh , do you know of anything that we might contact.  Uh , um , I , it , I don't know . Uh , it's , uh , that you've seen so many doctors , and they haven't prescribed anything that's been of assistance. . . .  No , uh , uh , oh , well , you know , they , they prescribed , the usual creams and salves and all that . Uh , Lidocaine patches and whatnot . I've tried all those things , and , uh , uh , they , you know , said they might relieve the , uh , a little bit of the itching and the soreness for a few hours , but , uh , the , the , none of them have offered anything in the way of a cure.  Okay , . Now , I have any of those doctors in a dermatologist. .  Yeah , uh , uh , the first time we talked to her was that a dermatologist , and , uh , but , uh , he said that , uh.  Okay , well , , I , I know that they're , oh , go ahead .. .  Uh , he , he prescribed , uh , you know , some salve , uh , the , uh , smeared on it , but like I say , it lasts , uh , it might give a little relief for just a few hours , but , uh , had no long term effects ..  And , uh.  Uh , .  Okay , um , uh , well , that's usually the recommendation for shingles is that you see a dermatologist . Um.  Yeah.  I , I don't , I don't know . I don't have any additional recommendations . I mean , uh , being that the dermatologist didn't work , I would suggest maybe trying a second dermatologist or possibly a neurologist . Have you seen a neurologist ? . .  .  .  Yeah , I've seen , uh , um , let's see , how many of these for a neurologist , I think , uh , three of them were neurologists , and , uh , uh.  They were not able to operate any help either . Um.  Uh. . .  .  Um.  One of them I seem to be really confident and , uh , um , uh , that I've been inspired confidence in me that , uh , uh , they knew what they were talking about , but essentially , it all came down to the fact that they're , uh , they could not offer any cure for a day also , prescribed another kind of , of the , of the support% lighter chain roll on , but , uh , that just lasted a couple of hours , too . Uh , , I'd , uh , just , uh , uh. .  And I , I , I , I , in fact , just , uh , last week , I went to see another doctor , uh , he was a general practitioner , supposed to be a geriatric doctor . This seems to be , uh , shingles affects older people . I don't know , maybe he might know , of course , I'm an older person to do on 91 , uh.  .  Okay .. .  .  Um.  Um-hum .  ..  All right.  But , uh , I , I , uh , he , he wasn't able to come up with any help . Um , but , uh , there must be somebody somewhere , though , and , uh , so , uh , but I appreciate your listening to my long sense story here , and , uh , uh , it's just kind of a question of straws , I thought maybe , uh , might start goals earlier or something , so.  .  Right . Um , I , I don't know . I mean , I would say reach out to the CDC , but I'm not sure that they'll be able to help you find somebody that can help you locally . I mean , they may be able to discuss , um , treatments with you or successful treatments , but I'm not sure if they'd be able to find someone like an actual doctor to help you out locally , but , I mean , they might be in sending you more information , or , or treatment options for it .. .  And , and , uh , so your suggestion , uh , uh , is that I just , people looking for a doctor.  Oh , I mean , , uh , right , they , I mean , because , like I said , I could give you the phone number to the CVC , but basically , they would just be able to probably give you more information than possibly options for treatment , but I don't think they'd be able to help you locate a local doctor.  Okay . All right . Well , we'll just keep trying , uh , uh , to the neurologist and , and see where we can , uh.  Okay.  .  Well , actually , if , if , uh , , uh , if , if I were you , sir , I would kind of focus on dermatologists , because in my experience , it's typically the dermatologists that treat the shingles outbreak . So , I would maybe focus on the dermatologists. . .  .  Wow ..  Okay . Well , that's , uh , that's what we'll do . And , uh , I , the , the neurologist that I did go to see was a , uh , uh , a group of , uh , uh , neurology , uh , doctors , and , uh , two of them participated in , uh , examinations and so on , uh , in fact I thought I was , uh , uh , so sore on the front of the chest , I thought I was having a heart attack and , uh , sent me to the hospital . . But , uh , uh , it was not a heart attack . It was just the shingles soreness.  Hum . Yeah ..  Uh , but anyway , uh , there has to be a , uh , uh , like I said , there has to be some more neurologists here in this , uh , I'm in the candidate city area , and , uh , so I'll just , uh , uh , look up another , uh , neurologist and , and give that a shot.  Uh , but.  .  Right , and , and , and again , if I were you , I , I soak this on . Not the neurologist , but the dermatologist . . Right , the .  Uh , dermatologist , I mean , yeah , excuse me , yeah , yeah . Um , okay , yeah , well , that's , uh , that's what I'll do , and , um , and , uh , thanks again for your advice . I appreciate it ..  .  Oh , yes , sir . You're welcome , and I hope you can find someone that can give you an answer , because that sounds extremely painful.  Okay . Well ,.  You have a nice day now.  And thanks again.  .  ?  Yes , sir . You was well , and thank you ..  And thanks again for your help . Bye.  Yes , sir . You're welcome . Bye bye .. \"\n",

Look , whoever I was talking before , they said they'd transfer , they said they would transfer me , and I have no idea what's going on at the end of the country . I'm just doing away with what they told me to do.  Okay . Uh , who , who , who ,.  They knew I was , what I was talking about , so why would they transfer me there ? That doesn't make sense. .  .  .

Yeah , it doesn't make sense at all . That's why I'm , I was a little bit , be fuddled .

Where did you get our number from ? .  No , I want to.  From , uh , whoever I was talking to.  Okay . All right ..  She didn't give me the number if you just transferred me. .  I don't either . ..  Okay , I , I'm , I'm not sure , I'm not sure why they would transfer you here . Um , I , I would , I would find out , , yeah , there , there's probably a phone number on your , on your necklace for you to call if there's something malfunctioning or on that paperwork you received , okay ? .  And then.  Well , that's what I started out with , and then this is the , this is the third person I've talked to , I want a lifeline . ..  Okay . All right . Um.  And I got.

No , I didn't , I didn't , I didn't have this number at all . The person I was talking to about lifeline is the one that connected me to you , so now I've got to start all over again . ..  I don't know if she got that number . She knew what I wanted.  .  ..

Well , I'm , I'm in Indianapolis , and I called CVS , which is a large pharmacy , and cross country , and they said they don't have any tragedy , elliptical , uh , within 50 miles of Indianapolis. .  Now , you said there's a nationwide shortage or something.  So , I'm trying to find out if that's true or not.  Well , sir , I'll be more than happy to research your inquiry . Um , may I collect your contraceptive information , or are you trying to get some Trulicity ? .  Yes ..  All right , sir , and I had.  I had a prescription called , called in for , uh , a year's worth of Dilaudid at a CVS in Avon , Indiana , and they said they just can't get any .  Hum.

May I have your telephone number , please ?.  , three , one , seven , two , seven , three , eight , five , four , five .. .  And your zip code.  Four , 6 , 2 , 3 , 4. .

You didn't solve them or they didn't pay their bills ?  You don't give it to them anymore or what's been trying to figure out , is there anyplace else , and then anaplist that would have it , is Walgreens carried it or someplace else , but they told me they just , there's a nationwide wide shortage and I'm just trying to see if that really is true.  All right . Are you on any about programs , sir.  Uh , no , I don't think so . I'm not sure . I'm not sure what programs you're talking about . Uh.  I'm trying to think ..  Okay ? Like we have the patient , the patient assistance program that assists out patient who are 65 years old or older , or , um , the coupon program .  .  Okay . . . .  Um , 6 , 164 , taken Breo Ellipta and Spiriva right now and my doctor is trying to get me something less expensive and he said Trulicity would only be $55 . 00 a month , versus $600 . 00 a month.  Um.  , ..  .  All right , sir . I'm going to place you on hold for a moment , and I'm , and I'm going to do some research , and inquiry , and this is Indianapolis . I'm going to inquire about that . One moment , please .  .  Thank you for holding Missouri . Um , I am inquired about , uh , um , a shortage , and , um , I am not seeing any knowledge of that , . Uh , I will bring it to the attention of my supervisor ,.  Okay . And does that mean if CVS is telling me that , and they got 100 stores , and then in an apple. .  I'm trying to figure out , is , do I need to go to another pharmacy , or are you not selling the CVS , or , that's what I'm trying to figure out , but you say that there is no shortage as far as you know.  That's correct , sir . There is no shortage as far as I can see . Um , I've checked all of the , uh , updates , , and , um. . .  They even told me the salesmen don't even have any samples anymore . .  .  So that's really , that's what was concerning to me.  .  . .  Well , I will , , I am making a note of this , and , um.  Let's see , I'm checking the back order . Status ..  I don't see anything about.  And like I say , does it seem , it seems , seems strange to , you know , there's at least 100 CVS stores in 50 miles of Indianapolis . . Zero would have any.  .  That's correct , sir . I am not seeing anything on my back order about hydralazine.  I am sorry that you experienced.  Um.  Um , sure , it must be a lot of other people too , so . Okay . Well , I'll start calling other pharmacies and see if they carry it.  I , I , I think that might be a good thing , because I'm not seeing anything about it , and like I said , I will bring this to the attention of my supervisor . Is there anything else I can assist you with today ?.  No , that's it .. .  All right , miss the web . We do appreciate your calling GSK .

      " \"Thank you for calling the response center . My name is that and then I'm a registered nurse . How am I going to assist you today ? . . . . . Okay . I took , I took the , the vaccine for the shingles . I've been putting it off and I was putting it off and thinking I would wait to make sure my husband did it , and then he went behind my back , and he took it . During the fall , I took , I took the flu vaccine . I'm , uh , um , 74 , or 73 again , I took the , the flu vaccine , but I didn't take the senior version about three year , two years ago , I got , took the senior version and the flu vaccine , and I got hives . So , when I took , when it , ever since then , every time I take flu vaccine , I always just take the regular one . We , it may be no help , but still , I'd just take the regular one . Okay , I've been taking the flu vaccine and the Clobex vaccine , and the shingles vaccine , and I took them , like , one month apart , bing , bing , bing , bing , bing , bing . So , and I , and when I had , and then I had , I had a reaction to the shingles vaccine , even with the first reaction I had to a vaccine , which was the flu vaccine . It took about 10 days , and all of a sudden , I had hives , and I , and , and , um , I couldn't even decide I did if it was from the vaccine or not , because I. . . . . . . Is he doing stuff , and , but , but , uh , I figured it had , it had to be , so that's when we dropped back on that . But I took the , the flu , I took the shingles vaccine , and , uh , about 10 days later , I had these , my back was killing me , it was itching so much , and , um , I had my husband look at it and he said , we've got , he took pictures of it , I can see if you want me to , you can see , give me a number , I could text him to you , but he had , it's in this little , little white pustule , slight shingles , and he looked at it and he said , that looks like shingles . So , I said , you know what , he showed me in a picture on the phone . I said , yeah , that looks like shingles . So , we called my doctor . She sent me , and she was fairly concerned . She kept asking me , are you having any pain ? And I said , no , I'm not having any pain. . . . . . . And so , um , it's just itching . So he sent me , I don't , I don't even know what he sent me , but he sent me , you know , the drug for , for shingles . And I took it and it , it calmed down and within , like , three or four days , it had gone away . But when I , when I went to do the second one , I've been kind of leery of doing the second one coming out , I don't want to go through all that itching thing again , but , or maybe I should just take that and take the pills right off the bat . I don't know what to do . So , anyway , when I talked to him about it , and I , a reminder , because he , first , she said , no , we shouldn't be any promising . I said , well , remember I got those pressure , he said , oh , yes , and so then , he said , no , don't take it . Well , both my husband and my best friend are both saying , what do you mean , don't take it ? When she first happened , we ask her , I've had shingles , like , 10 or 15 years ago , and when I took the vaccine , all of a sudden , I had this reaction , and they said , and she said , oh , it's not the vaccine , and they said , well , she said it was not the vaccine , and I said , well , yeah , everybody's going to say the first off the back . It's not the vaccine , but I said , it's , it , the fact that I got these little pustules in this itching , out of the clear blue after 15 years , you just can't look at that week to , to jump up . I said , no .. . . . Question is ?  Yeah .  I do , I've got to take , I want , I've got to take my second shot within the end of May if I'm going to , unless I can put it off . Tell me what to do . Should I , should I take this , it's not a matter of money or anything , it's just definitely , I don't want to cruck . So , I , um , uh , should I go ahead and take it or I'm , I'm pretty too far , apparently I'm trying not to , because when I saw a game where I , I thought I already had a , I lost a student , because I had a D in variety and she died , you know , she was in the hospital for two or three weeks and then she was gone . And , um , so I was , I've always kind of been leery of that . So , give me information , and it also says , we actually , the first shot , you actually are the second shot . So , I'll need to know , I guess , if I took the second shot , is it usually dosed more reaction , or less reaction , you know , because with the , with , um , with the boosters and stuff , with the pill , the youngster , I took all my clothing , I took the first one , the booster , I have not taken the second booster , but I don't think they have any problems with these new , um , you know , RDA or whatever it is that I call in the RTD2 , uh , vaccines . I don't have any problem with my culprit at. Except for the stuff like you feel miserable for a day when you take it and all that . So , give me some insight . I'm trying to decide what to do , but , uh , frankly , I'm going to , uh , I'm , I'm very nervous about taking the second shot.  Are you still there ?. Yes , ma'am , I , I'll be happy to help you with that today .  Yes , ma'am . I'm here . Uh , may I collect a small amount of contact information to document this event ? Is that okay ? .  Sure ..

In California , when you received this vaccine , and at the facility , did they provide you with , uh , any information that might have the lot number and expiration date ?.  Um , oh , no , because see , I just had it done in the grocery store and they just , they just stuck it in my arm and that was it.  .  Okay . And caffeine , uh ,.  And if they did , I didn't think to keep it.  Sure , absolutely fine . Caffeine , do you know the , the date of the administration , when you got that , the date ? .  It was in December . It was in December . I can't remember the exact date . I know that I had to have it done by May.  Okay , December of 2012..  Yeah ..  Perfect . And you mentioned that it was in the drugstore . Do you mind shareing the name and phone number of that drug store ? .  Okay . ..  I don't know the phone number , but I've got the name at the Walgreens , but I can't even tell you what street is on , because I don't drive . I never pay attention to the addresses . If you send me , if you send me an e-mail or something back , I can , I can get all the information out for you. .  .  Sure , okay , perfect . Thank you so much counseling . Caffeine , I'd like to place while I , uh , researched this question for you , and I'll be right back to assist you , okay ?.  Okay , thanks .. .  Should I if I understood with me ?.  Um , yep ..  Perfect . Thank you so much for your patience and holding while I research this , uh , question for us . Uh , so I'd like to start with the smallest disclosure and that's all that I'm a registered nurse . I'm unable to provide medical advice for medical questions . We do refer you to your healthcare providers , your primary resource for patient care . Would that being safe , Caffeine , I have the , uh , my resource for the frequent ask questions for shingles in front of me , and the question here , kind of , relates to what your , uh , what you're asking , one of your questions anyway . It says , if a patient , 50 years are older , had a reaction to the first shingles injection , does that mean that they will have a worse reaction after the second injection . So , it states here , it says it cannot be predicted to have any patient over respond after receiving any vaccine , including the first or second dose of shingles . There are some information I can share with you from data collected with , from our clinical trials . So , caffeine , there were two clinical trials . One was individuals greater than 50 years of , of age and and 70 years of age . And in those two trials , respectively.  GSK saw that patients reported headache and shivering more frequently during the second dose compared to the first dose , as well as grade three , general adverse reactions . And that means , uh , or , or , or defined as , uh , adverse reactions that prevent normal daily activities , those adverse erections were , were reported , more frequently after those two compared to dose one , or headaches , shivering , malaise , and fatigue , um , but , and individuals , uh , , uh , patient's individual experiences may not be the same . Uh , so ultimately , yes , uh , in those trials it was reported that , uh , second dose , uh , reactions were more frequent , um , but not necessarily relating to the one that you experienced . So , um , , that's the information I have ..  Well , I hate to say this , but this is , this is , it is , you're , it's , it's disappointing . I'm trying to find out from you . I mean , if I get this in croak , then I would probably be officially after calling you . All I'm saying , I try to get some information . The , the , the , if people end up , end up , um , feeling , uh , healthcare providers.  They don't help . Um , do you have any , have you got , and tell me I'm not the first . Have you got any record of , of , of my reaction from anybody else.  MRI , the only person on the plan.  Uh , you , your information ,.  Well , uh , basically , caffeine , I'll speak to this . So the information you provided me today is healthcare for protected information . Uh , I don't see any record of you and my system as it is . Uh , and , therefore , uh , I cannot , um , see that , , anyone who has reported.  But you all can , even though you don't identify the patient , you can still not tell me if you've got anybody else . You can't say we have three people out of 100 , 000 or three people out or three million . You can't tell me if you've ever even heard of this before.  Uh , I can't speak from the , um.  From the clinical trials , and in the clinical trials , uh , the , the , uh , adverse reaction , did you , did you report it.  The.  Yes , ma'am ..   .  Um-hum . .  Okay , but , but , are , have you been doing this for , you've been , you've been doing this for , the clinical trials , uh , or clinical trials . Okay , I work at the NIH to understand about clinical trials . But you've got data , uh , but since the day this came out , you've got a cold , slew of data of things that have happened to people that the doctors had called you and said , I've got a patient who's blah , blah , blah , correct ?.  I'm sure that they did.  Uh.  At .  At . Caffeine , uh ,.  I can't believe the immediate relief you've got , if you , okay . And you can't , and from that data , you can't say to me , yes , we've had , we've had this before , and , and you can't , it's , well , my doctor says no , and I'm pretty much inclined to say no . I'm just disappointed.  Yeah , and , uh , , uh , I am unable to provide medical advice and for medical questions , we do refer you to a healthcare provider as your primary source of patient care . So , I'm a nurse , but I'm not your nurse , and I do not have information about your individual situations , so I would recommend you follow your health care providers , guidance . . . . .  Okay . This is extremely disappointing . I'm going to be not making , I'm going to be recommending everybody I mean , if they do not take the shots , because there's , because there is no follow-up , there's no help , there's no assistance . If anything happens to you , you're just on your own , okay . Thank you so much , bye .\"\n",

Yes , ma'am ..  So , my insurance company won't pay it for it , for the way the doctor prescribed it , for pain . It's not arthritis.  So , that's why they won't approve it . And it's pretty expensive , but I'll tell you what . I've tried everything over the counter . I'm a commercial driver.  .  Um-hum .. .  And I'm , you're not taking any narcotics . My doctor doesn't want me taking anything that goes through the entire system such as pills and whatnot when this cream actually is right on spot.  Literally . Yesterday , this is a compliment , and some , somewhere where I can look further , uh , perhaps you could help me . But I was in Walmart yesterday to purchase this tube.  And a bunch of people were looking at all kinds of other stuff and looked all confused on this aisle. .  I pulled the Voltaren cream off . Not the generic . The brand name off the shelves . I said , here. . .  I'm a 9/11 survivor . This stuff is God . I've tried all of those . This stuff is God . And they literally , two tubes apiece . That's three customers looking at it. . . . . .  They don't even have to do their homework . Literally . I had a , uh , disk batch who was rubbing her knee . I had my prescribed one , because they only paid for it once , because it was through the ER . And she put it on , on her knee , I didn't tell her what it was , and she said , holy shit , what was that ? And I told her what it was , took a picture of it , and she wound up buying it . She goes , holy shit , this stuff works . Thank you , bingo . So , , question . I'm reading all the insides stuff , inside the thing , and it says it's only approved for arthritis and pain ..  How can we get it so it can be prescribed for other things. .  So , my insurance will pay for it . One , and two , um , I'm reading all your little prompts . I mean , you guys got coupons , uh , for. .  Um , supplies , do a doctor or , like , samples and things like that , because they say they don't have samples.  .  Oh , great , more than welcome to do some research towards going to be , uh , with to be seen if we can get some information towards , which would be the voltary and towards the , um , the prescription and as well as any financial assistance towards it .

And then I get .  Eight , nine , zero , three , three , yeah . I get spins and I work nights and this is really in the middle of my night's sleep , but I had two days of great rest , um , because I did , I ran out and , like I said , my insurance company refuses it , uh , they said it's FDA has not approved it for , for pain . When it clearly says , it's a forearm arthritis pain.  But , it's just pain in general.  .  Oh , okay . Yes , ma'am . So I'm just going to put. .  It , um  Yeah , it was .  And that and the fact just , so you also know , I haven't see three to seven fused in my neck . So , I do have difficulty swallowing pills . It does get stuck even water . So , this , this is a , uh , an excellent alternative . It's prescribed for off of what you use it for , that is , I know doctors do do that , ? But , my insurance company is , uh , it's like a fight.  .  Okay . Yes , ma'am ..  For the last year.  Yeah ..  Oh , okay . So what I'm going to do is just put you on a brief hole , do some research , chores to be , by finding information towards would be the Voltaren , uh , photocopy of the Incivek , okay ?.  Um-hum ..

Just so as you know.  Okay . Well , once again.  No pun intended .  Uh , no .  Yeah , I know , my husband died last year from taking one of those poisonous toxic concoctions after I told him not to ..  .  Okay ..  Um-hum ..  Yeah , we don't do experimentals or something like that , and I told him not to . Yeah . Now I got to deal with the military.  Um. .   .  Okay . Yes , you know what ? Once again , uh , that is the department that would have that information , uh , from what's going to have , um , there is any issues towards going to be , uh , if they are not answering , uh , one , more than welcome to see if I'm able to get somebody on the other end , but that's the only , uh , which would be the department that will be able to answer those questions .. .

Uh , they do have looked like to be a voice-mail , uh , looking at the option for you to leave a voice-mail for them to get in contact with you when that department does open back up , but as of right now , it's the only suggestion that I do have , uh , towards the beginning of those answers , uh , torture questions ..   Okay , yeah . They're not going to answer it because it's been months . And they don't return phone calls back. .  .  Okay . Well , I'm more than welcome to get in contact with my management towards to be seen , what's going on with that department . I want to be in , uh , on , um , fortunately , I wouldn't have any answers towards looking to be , uh , the Voltaren gel because , uh , that is that department that does handle that , uh , which would be , um , product . So , um , once again , more than welcome to leave a voice-mail , but as in , uh , more than welcome to get in contact with my management to see what's going on with that department ..  Okay , it's been months , so they don't return phone calls back.  Okay .  So there is no assistance . .  .  Well , what.  And people need assistance . It's , it's not month . We're talking about six months.  Once again ,.  If you're going to do apologize for the situation it won't be on more than one getting contact with my manager and see what's going on with the situation with that department . But unfortunately , I wouldn't have any answers towards your question at that Voltaren department would have , have the answers towards the questions.  Right .  Okay . Uh , home , I'll be on hold while you contact your manager , please . Thank you .. .  Yes .. .  , do you miss me ?  .  . No , , we're holding . So , yes , ma'am , I did get in contact with my management . Um , my management is currently trying to figure out or trying to get in contact with libido department to see , uh , what's going on on that side , uh , we don't have any information towards a return time for looking to be the information , but once again , um , we wouldn't have the information on this side of looking to be the department towards answering the questions . We do apologize for the inconvenience , but we are going to investigate what's going on with that side , the consumer healthcare side , uh , looks to be , um , of that department , but once again , unfortunately , I , we don't have the answers towards your questions . It will be that voltary and , uh , department that would have those answers .. . .  Okay . I like to have samples delivered to my surgeon's office , but one , two , they say they have coupons . If they don't answer their phone in six months , or return phone calls in six months , what does that tell you ? .  And once again , I do apologize for the inconvenience , but I , I don't have any information towards it . It could be the Voltaren Gel . It would be that department.  No , not really . I understood , I wanted to talk to you about the apologize if you cannot fix it.  Okay .. .  Uh , it's , it , you don't apologize . If you cannot fix it , don't ever apologize to somebody , because most of the time , 99 . 9% of the time , people are going to get mad because it's a flakey number , please don't do that , okay ? So , otherwise , it's technically fraud . If they don't answer their phone and they don't respond. . .  Back to any , any , uh , e-mails , phone calls , nothing , zero , nada.  Now , if they consume or help , if you don't respond.  One is false advertising , fraud. .  I'm a transportation supervisor . I'm also the paralegal . So , they come to me with all their illegal advice.  Okay . . .  Contract wise , one of my specialties . And it all depends on who you ask . They might say , oh , my god , she's an F in bitch . Oh , yeah , this New Yorker can be quite the F in bitch . Being deceased , being deceasedful . Not , uh , in your control on purpose , but when they do the runaround.  And there are no answers. . .  But they have it in writing if you need , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom . Well , if I need , then I do one . Please call to none of that stuff is available for the last six months . That is unacceptable , so everything I'm writing that you have on your box is fraud. . .  Because I did do what they said , leave a message . I do every week.  For the last six months.  No we're doing phone calls . No return e-mails . Nothing .. .  Yes , ma'am ..  They all give a number that goes to  Right .  That's fraud.  Yes , ma'am , what , once again , I did get in contact with my student.  Billing , being delivered ?  .  No , I understand that . Being deliberately unavailable. .  That's , uh , speaks of volumes. .  I get to my people within 24 hours . Actually , before I go to bed , I'm up in the middle of my night sleep.  I've got five more hours of sleep , because you're on a different time zone.  To call you.  So , I actually did my sluting , and , uh , there's another number for GlaxoSmithKline . Let's call them to get the , to get the same information as to what.  You just said .  Sulfa physician has a question , getting back to them more than six months later , that's unacceptable.  So , how do we go about getting coupons and getting it delivered ? If they don't answer their phone , it's subcutaneous.  Uh , once again , . Once again , unfortunately , I don't have the answers towards that , uh , towards that question . Um , what can I do to get in contact with my supervisor towards seeing what's going on with that department that's all I can do as a right now ? Is there anything else I can help you with today ? .  Before I blast you on Facebook and every other social media and consumer , better business bureau.  Not you personally . It won't take it personally , because , like I said , it all depends on who you ask if I'm going to be the bitch.  Okay . Well , thank you for choosing GSK\"\n",

Yeah , I just spoke to someone , and they said that , uh , the doctor asked to write another prescription . I have to fill out another application . Uh , I have to spend the $600 . 00 out of pocket . Uh , and then , uh , apply in the program . Well , spitting the $600 . 00 out of pocket is , you know , I have insurance that takes care of other medication that this one is the one that's just outrageously . , what is the one that works ? . .  .  Uh , okay , Miss Journal , uh , uh , I , I totally understand what you're saying , but I'm , I'm a little loss , I'm a little loss , uh , because the patient assistance program.  Uh , are you on a different program , ma'am , ma'am ?.  Well , I , I , I don't know . I thought it was a patient assistance , because I got the three boxes free.  Oh , okay . So , you , so , so they're saying you have to reapply. . . .  Yeah , I mean , and I , you know , this has been two or three months ago , but they , they said this , and I , I want to start taking it and call my doctor . The pulmonary doctor , he said , no , no , no . You cannot take that . You have to have the 200 , well , then , uh , , nobody can see the help . The doctor gave me some samples , , that they had , and they run out , and , uh , I'm , I'm in the mess . , but I've gotten three boxes here . I can send them back to you guys , , uh , because I'm , I can't use them .. . .  But then they're telling me I've got to fill out all these , well , fill me out , all of this stuff and fitting the 600 holes . .. .  So I said spitting the $600 . 00 out of pocket , you know , if that takes a while , because , like I said , I do have insurance that takes care of other medications for me , and , uh , then I went through a program on the , uh , Xarelto , that they've given me a year's worth of helping . Anyway , I'm just in a mask , , and I was just hoping somebody could just see if would help me .. .  Uh , oh , okay , ma'am . Let me , um , let me get a representative from the patient assistance program on the phone , okay ?.  Okay ..  One moment please ..  Okay ..  Miss , well , my thank you for holding . I'm transferring you to Miss Tiffany , and our patient assistance program , and she's going to pull up your records to see what's going on , okay ?.  Thank you , Doc . I appreciate it.  Yeah , you're , you're very welcome ..  Hi.  All right , good morning . This is keeping a year of the GSK patient assistance program . I understand you have some questions in regard to neutrality , 100 that you received. . . .  Yes , uh , okay , they sent me three boxes and it was supposed to have been in the 200s . Uh , they told me that my doctor , the prescription they sent was , uh , 100 , and my doctor was saying that they ordered the 200. Anyway , I went through the program of , you know , I had to spend $6 , 000 , $600 out of pocket , and , uh ,. . .  So , the doctor and the family doctor tried to give me some samples . I , I just can't afford it . I didn't feel anything that's really helped . So , my family doctor put me on , uh , uh , another kind for now . So , I , I just kind of gave that , didn't go back , didn't know what to do , and , uh , I mean , I got the three boxes here , , that , uh , you guys sent me , but I can't take them . And , uh , so , then , whoever I talked to before , you , they said , , that I would have to have the doctor write another prescription to fill out another application in , in the $600 . 00 out of pocket at to apply to the program , . Well , that , that took quite a while when I did it the last time . And , , the $600 . 00 out of pocket , I've got insurance , and it , it really helps me with my other medications . And then , I'm on a program. \"\n",

But the person that registered him a while back and no longer works here , and I'm not able to order the samples , so I was wondering , like , would you go to reset it ?  Well , I'll try , because a little bit of that wants to think about , um , ..  Is , are you asking to reset the pen number.  The whole thing . I can't get into it .  Sure .  To order temples .

Okay , let's look at your address for me .. .  Eleven twenty-one . Try with Avonex , week [##redacted##].  Is that the name of your street for me to make sure I have that correct , please ?. . .  Um-hum ..  And.   Yes ..  Can you tell the man up your street for me to make sure I have that correctly.  Uh , 11:21 , try with avenue , sweetie , 10:00 , Columbus Tennessee , 3:00 , 4:10.  Can you spell the name of your street for me , ma'am , to make sure I have that correct please ?.  Oh , T R , I can't , here , it sounds like you're , like , far away.  I do apologize . Can you hear me better now ?.  Uh , no , it still sounds the same. .  Like , I don't know if I want to speak her phone , or.  Can you spell the name of your street for me to make sure I have that correct , ma'am ?.  P R O T W O O D. . .  And is it cold , please ?.  Three , eight , four , zero , one.  That was the last name of the healthcare provider you were calling about.  Norvir , [##redacted##]. .  And the last name now.  You said his last name was ..  Worse than the last name of the healthcare provider you're calling number half of , please.  [##redacted##] , John , Michael , Norvir.  And the NPI number 3 ?.  One , five , five , eight , three , one , zero , three , six , seven. .  I need ,.  Uh , we can just reset it ..  Thank you so much for providing that information for me earlier . So the process of getting into an account , if you're unable to get into the vehicle , or you did not create the account , if you're able to get in and you just need the pin number , I can transfer you to get the phone number reset , or you can delete the entire account , or we can delete the account on our side for you , if you're unable to get in and delete it . You would have to wait 24 business hours in order for you to go back in . You can go back in and reset up an entire new account . I'm sorry ?.  You can just , like , transfer me to reset it.  Well , are you able to actually get in the account , or you cannot get in because you need a phone number reset.  I just , I personally don't know what e-mail it was you , what was used for it , because the person that did do it does no longer works here.  Right , that's what , that I understand , ma'am , but if you're , if you just need a pen reset , you wouldn't have to know some of that information . Um , but if not , I mean , I'll go ahead and transfer you to get the pen with that . If that doesn't work for you , then we can delete the account and you would have to start over again with his information and put in the license number . It takes.  So would you , would you all be able to provide me with the e-mail.  Okay ..   It , I just know.  No , ma'am , we cannot provide you with the e-mail . We can't verify the e-mail.  Um , would I be able to ask you if there's this one , and then you confirm it.  No , ma'am . We cannot confirm any inflammation on the account.  So , how come , why ? You could just reset it , and we'll wait 24 hours , because that just don't make no sense.  I thought you said I would have to wait 24 hours.  Okay , so we don't reset it , ma'am . What I'm saying to you is that we delete the accounts. .  ..  We delete the entire account . Once we delete the account , you can wait 24 hours and go back in , and you would have to reput in all of the information , including the license , and all of that information . Once you do that , it takes four to five business days to go through a verification process , and at that time , you are able to order samples online.  So that's why I was giving you the choice . We can either delete the pill.  So , the only way , the only route I can go is that one.  Okay . I'll go ahead and get that , uh , calendar made it for you , ma'am ..  Because I mean , I wouldn't be able to , I wouldn't be able to go into it to , to do all that , right ? Because you all can't give me the e-mail. .  Oh.  That is correct , unless you can get in and we just need to do the pen reset , but again , I don't really know the issues that you're having , except you can't get in to be accounted to order samples . So with that , we only have two options . We can transfer you over to our acute Pharmacy department , and they will assist you with setting that pen number , or we can delete the entire account for you , and then you would have to put all of that information in , allow it to go through the verification process , and then you can order samples.  .  It doesn't , it delays it .  Just delayed it.  Okay . I can go ahead and delete that account for you , ma'am .  Okay .  Is there anything else I can assist you with today ?.  Around.  Thank you so much for calling GlaxoSmithKline , a brief optional survey will follow\"\n",
      " \"Thank you for calling the response center . My name is Jamaica , a pharmacist . Tell me I help you today . .  Okay .. Hello , this is the erectile dysfunction reimbursement resource center . And I have a patient on the other line with a , um , possible product quality compliant for the , uh , Flovent Diskus.

Uh , phone number of two , zero , one , five , seven , three , eight , five , three , eight. .  .  Okay , the phone cut out in the middle of that there . I got 201 , 3A.  Five , seven , three.  Eight , 5 , 3 , 8.  Okay . Thank you ..  And is it occurred of zero , seven , six , four , five ?.  Zero seven , six , four , five . Okay ..  All right . And she said that it has a really , uh , it has a , uh , I guess a plastic taste to it , and it's , it feels like it's , um , I guess , disposed , dispensing too much medicine ..  Okay , all righty , I'll talk to her . Thank you ..  Sure . When do you have a , uh , um , an ID , a record number , in case somebody , yeah ..  Okay , no . , yes , it's 138.  Um-hum .  It , it'll start over . It was 138/80 , 84..  All right . Thank you very much . Here she comes ..  , thank you ..  Hi , buddy ..  Hi ..  I bet really this is jammed it . I'm one of the pharmacists here at GSK , and air Excedrin , you're calling about your Flovent Diskus , um , having a , a bad plastic taste , and you feel it's dispensing too much medication . Is that right ?.  ?  Correct ..  Okay . Um , if I'm mad , I'd like to ask a few questions about the discuss . Um , see if we can figure what's going on and what we can do to fix it for you . Um , first to begin , I just wanted , , oh , go ahead . Where are you going to say something ?. . .  Okay ..  Okay .. .  Uh-huh .. .  Okay ..  Sure . No ..  Yeah , I'm , I'm not in the fixing mode for the death , so I've called the pharmacy with it , and I said I wanted to change over to the aerosol , because there's something wrong , and , you know , whether it's made in China , I , I just don't want , you know , a disk again , but the , I've been taking this a number of years , and I , I just know when something is really wrong . I mean , I'm not a crazy person , so I , , and so I just don't want , you know.  Um-hum . Good.  Something to happen to someone who maybe is not , you know , going to follow through , that's all . But I'm , I'm not taking any more discs . Uh , that's out of the question.  So.  , ..  Okay . Um , what , okay , in that case sparingly , then , what I can do is I'll ask the questions about the diskus , and I'll file a product quality compliant , and we'll ask for the diskus to be a return to us , and , um , and then , you would have to follow-up with your doctor to get a , a new prescription for a , a different product . Um , I can't replace the diskus with a different product , . Um , does that make sense , , or do you have questions about that ?.  Um , uh-huh ..  Oh ..  Um-hum . Okay ..  Okay .. .  Um-hum ..  , I'm sure the roommate in China , and I'm sure , no matter what company , a five year old is on the assembly line , so I'm not , I , I'm not saying different , I'm saying , better , and I just , uh , uh , and I'm not , and I just don't , you know , I like to go along with the coupon part , because I've already called the doctor , too , but , um , I don't , there's a part of me that doesn't want this burritos somewhere , because if there's , this is in your lungs , and once you do this , you can't pump your stomach . It's not going to change . And , um.  Um-hum ..  Okay . And , okay . Uh , uh-huh.  It just isn't right . I don't , uh , this is not , there's something wrong with this , and I know it . After years of taking it , I'm having , uh , I'm not new to this game , so it's. . .  Yes , ma'am , and as you said , you've told me you're an experienced user , and I respect that . And as I said , I'd like to ask questions to see what is going on with the Flovent , so that it can be reported . It won't be , you know , varied . We will report it and look into it , and that's also why we ask for the Flovent to be returned to us , okay ? , um , if I may , just wanted to verify your name , the spelling of your name , [##redacted##] , and your last name is H E C , HT , is that correct ? .  Um-hum ..  Yes ..  Okay .  And your phone number.  [##redacted##] , 3 , 8.  And you're mailing address.  Yes.  . What , okay . is asking for your mailing.  Um-hum .. .  Uh , are you going to mail me something when I need something tonight ?  Well , what is , what good is it going to do me ? I mean , I'm , I have asthma . What good would it do with ? Uh , five days , I'm going to wait to get it , uh , coupon . First of all , under my coverage , maybe I can , I'll pay for it , , and I can send in my , to the FDA or so . I mean , I just , I don't necessarily , I'm not waving here , as far as days , uh , that's , uh , it was three days or whatever the mail , whatever it sends to me , a coupon . I mean , I need authorization . I mean , I have to take it tonight.  Um-hum .  .  Um-hum . Um-hum . Um-hum . Okay . And , and barely , what I'm hearing is that you , okay ..  And I , so the plan , I don't know what the plan , what , how this plan what it does with what you're doing . I mean , in other words , if the prescription is written to 30 days , then I just filled this , I just opened it , um.  Hum ..  .  Um-hum ..  Okay ..  All right . So , what are the plans going to do ? I mean , they're going to say , no , you just open it . How is the plan going to know that you sent me a coupon ? They're going to just think , I , I just doubled dipped in less than a month , no , I mean.  Okay . Okay . Never , [##redacted##] , I ask some.  Okay . You don't ,.  Okay .. .  I mean , I have to do what interests me and benefits me , because we all know the society does not benefit the people . They're the victims . So , what I want to know is how your , this call is for you to read , the purpose , correct me if I'm wrong , is to reimburse me . I'm saying to you.  .  Um-hum ..  Well , good is a coupon in the mail . When you have asthma.  Um-hum ..  So , why am I even on , I mean , I don't know , what are we doing ?.  I , I don't understand.  Okay . Okay . Well , what , what I'm doing here , and the reason you , initially to spoke with Aricept , um , about a coupon , is that correct ? The person you just spoke with , and he transferred you to me. .  Uh-huh ..  Uh-huh .  .  Okay . Okay ..  Well , that's what Wegmans said that , but you would think that you could scan Wegmans , the pharmacy , a coupon . But if you're going to put this in the mail , what I'm saying to you is I need something tonight . I don't need a coupon in the mail , so is that how you do it , if that's. .  Okay , and there are no , there are , no , there are no coupons for Flovent , so I will not be sending a coupon . There aren't any . Um , you have , you have two , , uh , a couple of options , if you're staying on the Flovent diskus , but as I understand , you said you do not want to stay on the Flovent Diskus , is that correct , [##redacted##].  Yeah . Yeah , that , that , if I said it , it's correct.  Okay . Then in that case , um , I cannot replace this for you . You will need to call your doctor to get a prescription for a different product if you do not want to be on the Flovent Diskus.  Well , I'm not paying the copay on this out of my pocket . So , understand that . So , the , if I have to go to the FDA , I'm not paying , if you send me some , if you send me a sweater without an arm on it.  Um-hum ..  Um-hum .. . .  Yeah .  Um-hum . Um-hum . Okay . And , um-hum . Okay ..  Okay ?.  I can barely . I can't barely , barely . I can't help . I.  Um-hum ..  That doesn't , uh , I'm going to send it back and the department store will credit me . They'll , there's no arm . But I am , I could have possibly , God knows what could have happened this morning with this . Could have died or could have something damaged to my lungs . And I still don't know if the next died doesn't have that , and I'm not so sure that this isn't a bad back . So , I'm not going to just let it die , no , and I'm not going to pay for this to kill me . I mean , I'm not buying my own arsenic . So , if you can't help me , , in that way , that's fine . No , that's fine . I can take it to a lab . I can do whatever I want to do , because , no . If you can only replace the disk , and these are the rules , see , that's what I'm getting at , the rules . The rules.  Um-hum .  .  Okay . Okay ..  Um-hum .  ..  Uh , the rooms change for some people , but not for others . But what I'm saying to you is I paid X for this when I picked it up at the pharmacy , because I'm not going to do this again , I being penalized , and I don't get reimbursed Xs , so why am I making the call for ? What purpose is this called ?.  Um-hum ..  I mean , I don't understand it . It's just something wrong with this.  Um-hum . Okay . And , um-hum . Um-hum ..  Um-hum ..  Yes ..  Okay . And bed really.  Yes ..   Okay . .. . .  .  Um-hum ..  It's , if you don't believe it , is Aricept doesn't believe it . It's a man in the moon does it . I don't care . It's a relevant to me . I know there's something wrong with this . And if it's a batch , then somebody can be hurt . I know what these , what the taste , and I don't know nothing , and you're not going to pay me bags , no , okay , fine , don't . You know , what I said , I'm going to answer questions for you , and tell me what my symptoms are , and you're going to say to me , no , unless you take this poison back again in a different form , I'm not going to do , I'm not going to , you know , get you a stupid money . That's all . It doesn't make sense to me . Why am I talking to you to begin with ? I might as well seem seemingly and impartial authority like an FDA thing , an arm of something , and at least let them look at what I'm saying.  Because I know for a fact there's something wrong.  On two levels , not on one.  Okay . ..  So , what I'd like to look , what are we saying to each other ? Nothing. .  So , I'm not going back to a disk . You got that one wrong wrong . I mean , that's out of the question. .  .  Okay . Okay . Okay . And by the way , you declined to answer questions about what's gone wrong with the disk you have , so that we can research it and see . Okay . No , ask . It is . Uh-huh ..  Um-hum .. . .  . And you declined and in this call should be monitored , because you declined to even give me a credit , so as , so a person in Brooklyn , an older person who has on a limited budget , you won't even give that person credit , so that person will probably finish this poisonous disc , and die , or something will happen during , and they'll say she died of a heart attack . When in fact , there may be something here . So , not I declined , you declined , doing the right thing , and the right thing is , I paid for this , it's the wrong product , and it goes into a person's lungs . This is not a sweater for an answer of policy.  So , yeah , I declined , but you declined , too . So , we.  Mutual declination. . . .  There isn't ? I don't know . I'm not going to , uh , talk about this , because I'm wasting my time . I had a whole day ahead of me . I know what path I have to take . I am not taking this again . Period . End of story . There's something wrong with that disk . . . .  Yeah , you want to have this on your conscience go ahead , have it.  ..  Do you have any other , , uh , okay ..  Um-hum .. .  So that's it . There's nothing to say . I mean , I don't know , what do you , what do we say to each other ? Nothing . You declined me . I paid for a defective product . Don't put it on me . Don't put it on the consumer . Don't put it on the victim . This is not big formed games here . This is my lungs.  You declined . You want me to. . . .  .  .  Oh .. .  Um-hum .  Copay . Okay , I can well afford it , but the next guy can't . And I want to get to the bottom of this , because you made it disgusting . I am not going to wear this sweater with one arm , so sorry , you're taking it back , and you're paying me for what I paid , to protect the next person , who can't afford this. . .  So that's it . I'm done . And if there's an old woman in Brooklyn , who dies from this , it's on your conscience . It's not on mine . Goodbye .. \"]\n"

Um , I also have to take , um , I've been taking 2 , um , ibuprofens and 1 Tylenol , um , 1 for inflammation and 1 for pain , um , I thought maybe the , um , uh , uh , excuse me , the ibuprofen would help . So that , um , I could breathe , and I don't know if I should be doing that or not , but I , I've been doing that as well. . .  All right , so , uh , is there a question about concern of taking ibuprofen and atenolol along with in the car , is what you're concerned is.  Yes , is it okay to do that ?. .  .  Okay .
